/*
        Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

        You use it to make HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to APIs or servers, similar to fetch, but with more powerful features.

        Axios simplifies making and managing HTTP requests, making it easier than the built-in fetch() in many cases.

        1) Autmatically converts the Fetched data into JSON no manual conversion needed.
        2) Built in error check which gives the error based on status code , no need of manual checking as fetch.
